    "#### Modules\n",
    "Functions are a step in the right direction but they still have the problem that to use functions from one script in another you'll have to copy and paste them over. The answer to this is to move the functions to a common location which both scripts can access. The Python solution for this are *modules*. In this way we can use modules from the Python standard library, or we can create our own modules and share them with others. Some example usage looks like:\n",

    "# use built-in \"math\" module\n",

    "#### Exceptions\n",
    "*Exceptions* are Python's error-handling system. They're not just there to tell you off, a good error message is to tell you that the computer has got into a situation where it doesn't know what to do and is asking you, the programmer, to help it by giving more information. We can raise different [types of exceptions](http://docs.python.org/library/exceptions.html) within our code and functions to produce error message which the person calling the code *cannot* ignore. This is very useful as it helps prevent writing incorrect code and becomes especially important when we share our code with others."
