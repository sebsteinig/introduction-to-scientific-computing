    "Let's use the power of NumPy to work on a very long-standing problem: finding a numerical approximatopn for the numper $\\pi$. Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and people have tried for [thousands of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80#:~:text=Zu%20Chongzhi%20is%20known%20to,accurate%20as%20his%20decimal%20result.) to compoute its value to the highest accuracy possible. We are going to try to find our own numerical solution to estimate $\\pi$ now and we are doing this by simply playing darts!"
