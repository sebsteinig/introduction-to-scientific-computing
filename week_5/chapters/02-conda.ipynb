    "In the very first lecture, we installed the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) software to easily start working with Python on nearly any operating system.

    "This week, we want to make use of some great Python packages that were specifically developed for our needs to handle and visualise geographical data sets. Some of them are not part of the standard (or base) environment that Anaconda created during the installation process. Luckily, Anaconda (or more specifically conda) itself provides a very convenient way of installing additional Python packages on our computer by managing additional packages and creating new [conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)."

    "## The base environment\n",
    "A conda environment is a specific set of Python packages that we can easily create, load and switch between depending on our needs and preferences for any given task. When we installed Anaconda, it automatically created an environment called 'base' with a recent Python version and relatively large collection of the most popular third-party packages like JupyterLab, NumPy, or matplotlib. This is the environment that we used so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see what kind of environments you have installed and what packages they contain in the Anaconda Navigator when you click on `Environments` on the left side below `Home`. You can select the base environment and will see a list of all installed packages on the right. When you change the dropdown menu from `Installed` to `Not installed` you will get an even longer list of packages that you that you could add to your `base` environment. But Sometimes, adding new packages might also update or change existing packages due to certain requirements of dependencies that conda has to meet in order to add new packages. This might lead to some unexpected behaviour and and  won't work at all on any UoB terminal computer. To avoid these problems, we are going to create a completely new environment specifically for this course. "
