    "In practice, we will normally not work with individual geometries, but rather with collections of geometries (e.g., the shapes of all countries, locations of capitals, ...). We can read, modify and visualise these vector layers very easily with the [GeoPandas package](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/). The main data type in GeoPandas is the `GeoDataFrame`. You can best think of a `GeoDataFrame` as a table of geographical vector data like in the schematic below."

    "Note: `GeoPandas` is using this 'table' approach because it is primarily build upon the `pandas` package, the premier Python tool to work with tabular data, i.e. everything that looks similar to an Excel spreadsheet. As a result, most of the syntax is actually very similar between `pandas` and `GeoPandas`. We don't cover `pandas` in this course, but if you ever encounter the need to work with this kind of data, there is a great free course developed by the University of Bristol ACRC that you can access [here](https://milliams.com/courses/data_analysis_python/).
