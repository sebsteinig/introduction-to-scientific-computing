    "## The base environment\n",
    "A conda environment is a specific set of Python packages that we can easily create, load and switch between depending on our needs and preferences for any given task. When we installed Anaconda, it automatically created an environment called 'base' with a recent Python version and relatively large collection of the most popular third-party packages like JupyterLab, NumPy, or matplotlib. This is the environment that we used so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see what kind of environments you have installed and what packages they contain in the Anaconda Navigator when you click on `Environments` on the left side below `Home`. You can select the base environment and will see a list of all installed packages on the right. When you change the dropdown menu from `Installed` to `Not installed` you will get an even longer list of packages that you that you could add to your `base` environment. But Sometimes, adding new packages might also update or change existing packages due to certain requirements of dependencies that conda has to meet in order to add new packages. This might lead to some unexpected behaviour and and  won't work at all on any UoB terminal computer. To avoid these problems, we are going to create a completely new environment specifically for this course. "

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "conda is a great way to handle the installation of packages and their dependencies on different operating systems. You might have noticed the long list of packages that were installed during the creation of a relatively easy environment. You really don't want to deal with those dependencies manually. Nevertheless, conda is not perfect and you might encounter some strange error messages once you start installing your own packages. What kind of problems you encounter heavily depends on your own operating system and local conda settings, so some things that work on one computer might not necessarily work exactly the same on another computer. Below are some problems I encountered on the University of Bristol Windows terminals. Please let me know if you run into any other problems and we can add them to the list:\n",
    "- In part 1 of exercise 1 you can cat the following error message if you don't specify the conda-forge channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "    <font color='red'>PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <font color='red'>- contextily</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Try to create the environment with the `-c conda-forge` argument to fix this problem.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Whenever you create a new environment on the Windows terminals, you will get a 'User Account Control' dialog poppinng up asking whether you want to allow 'python.exe' to make changes to your device. Simply select 'No', this does not cause any problems.\n",
    "- On the Windows terminals, conda creates any new ennvironment in the user's home directory. This allows us to use conda even with restricted user rights. But it will also mean that any environment we install will only be available on the specific computer that we installed it on. So if you want to use an environment that you created in a previous lecture, make sure to login to exactly the same terminal as before. It might also be that the files in your home directory get deleted at some point without notice, so it is best to not rely on them!"
