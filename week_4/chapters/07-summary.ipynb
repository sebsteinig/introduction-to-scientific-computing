    "- NumPy arrays and how to select and manipulate them\n",
    "- Creating NumPy arrays with built-in functions\n",
    "- Performing mathematical and logical operations on NumPy arrays\n",
    "- Dealing with multiple dimensions\n",
    "- Combining arrays when they are not exactly the same shape\n",
    "- Plotting data from NumPy arrays in one and two dimensions\n",

    "If you want more details on NumPy then have a look at [the official absolute beginner's guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html) or, in more depth, the [quickstart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last weeks, we had some practice sheets at this place to work through some short exercises covering the week's material. This week, we will just have one, slightly more difficult exercise to put everything you learned about NumPy and plotting into practice. You can find the instructions to work through the exercise on your own [here](08-homework) and we will discuss the results in next week's lecture together. Remember, that my office hours are on Friday 11am-noon in BS12 (room S1) or on Teams in case you have any problems with the homework. Good luck!"
