    "Before we come to the summary of this week, let's get some more practice with NumPy and plotting of multi-dimensional data. The final data in the weather data file is information about wind velocity, specifically [`\"wind_u\"`](https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db/?id=165) which is the wind speed in $ms^{-1}$ towards the East and [`\"wind_v\"`](https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db/?id=166) which is the same towards the North.\n",
