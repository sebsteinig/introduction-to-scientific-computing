Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and people have tried for [thousands of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80#:~:text=Zu%20Chongzhi%20is%20known%20to,accurate%20as%20his%20decimal%20result.) to compoute its value to the highest accuracy possible. We are going to try to find our own numerical solution to estimate $\\pi$ now and we are doing this by simply playing darts!"

    "We are going to make use of the fact that we are actually not very good at playing darts! We start by putting a blue square behind and around our green dartboard to protect our wall like in the above schematic. We are really bad at this, so every dart we throw will allways land at some random point within the square above. Sometimes we will even hit the actual green dartboard. Hooray! After some (very long) time we notice that the overall probability at which our darts land within the green area is actually not random but seems to converge to a fixed number. The math guy in the group points out that we can actually use our pathetic display to estimate $\\pi$. But whow?"

    "If you re-run your solutions from above you will notice that you will get a different shape of your curve each time. This is expected, but it would be nice to actually account for this random behaviour by attaching an uncertainty to each of our $\\pi$ estimates along our simulation. You could manually re-run your code 10, 100 or 1000 times and calculate the mean and standard deviation across your results. But you would probably agree, that this is a quite tedious process. Instead, your task is to adjust your code from above to simply add another dimension to your array of dart positions that represents the individual trials (or realisations) of your experiments. Implement M = 100 trials of your simulation and finally plot the mean and uncertainty envelope of your $\\pi$ estimate."
