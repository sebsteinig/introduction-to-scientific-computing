    "\n",
    "[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) (short for Numerical Python and pronouced *num-pea* or *num-pie*) is a third-party Python module for numerical programming. Any time you have collections of numbers, either one-, two- or more dimensional, then NumPy is likely to help you out. It provides you with a large suite of tools, algorithms and techniques. It is one of the most commonly used Python packages around and is used in the majority of Python-based scientific software."
